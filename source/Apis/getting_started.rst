Getting Started
===============

To list all of the Block Storage volumes on your account send a :py:class:`GET` request to :py:class:`/v2/volumes`.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called :py:class:`volumes`. This will be set to an array of volume objects, each of which will contain the standard volume attributes.

The :py:class:`region` may be provided as query paramater in order to restrict results to volumes available in a specific region. For exmple: :py:class:`/v2/volumes?region=nycl`
